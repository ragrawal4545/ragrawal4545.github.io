### Background 

In North America, at the end of September 2020, acres burned by wildfires exceeded the 10-year average by 1.3 million. Wildfires present many risks, including fatalities, property damage, secondary explosions at industrial plants, and environmental damage. As global warming accelerates, causing temperatures to rise and extreme weather events to occur more often, wildfires are becoming more frequent, intense, and costly. A pressing need exists to enhance risk assessment capabilities and predict attributes of wildfires to achieve better containment. 

Remote sensing data, as well as information about past wildfires, meteorological conditions, and vegetation, can be used to monitor, contain, and prevent wildfires as well as predict occurrences and probable paths.

### Problem Definition 

We will create two models. Given a particular US location and a future time (month and year), we will (i) predict whether or not a wildfire will occur, and (ii) if it will occur, predict the damage it will cause by land area. 

### Methods

To predict whether or not there will be a wildfire, given a time and location, we will train a binary classification model using a labelled [dataset](https://github.com/ouladsayadyounes/WildFires/blob/master/WildFires_DataSet.csv) to classify the given inputs as “fire” or “no_fire” (supervised learning, see Fig. 3).

If our first model has predicted there will be a fire, we’ll use a second logistic regression model to estimate the overall damage of the fire, trained on a second [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/elikplim/forest-fires-data-set) (see Fig. 4). This dataset will train our model to learn the relationship between the area of burned land (output) and features like month, temperature, humidity, rain, wind speed, etc (input).

In the final product, the user will be able to simply enter their location and time. The NDVI index, LST index, and features like historic temperature, humidity, wind conditions, etcand can be determined using the given time and location via web-scraping. These will then be vectorized to be fed into the two models along with the inputs.

### Potential Results

For the binary classification problem, we expect to obtain a high degree of accuracy, taking cue from the results obtained by Sayad et al. on predictive modelling of wildfires using the same dataset. For the subsequent risk assessment problem, we expect relative humidity, wind speed, temperature, and rain to emerge as strongly related to damage assessment.

If the model is robust, we hope to be able to generalize these results for locations outside the United States. 

### Discussion

We recognize that the datasets we use may be too small for us to obtain accurate results. In that case, we will use a third [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires) and web-scrape for the humidity, temperature, forest cover, etc. features that we will need. 
 
Another potential difficulty faced by our model would be to capture the years of time gap between two forest fires in the same region accounting for the natural phenomenon of forest regrowth. We may be able to improve this by supplementing our training dataset with additional information such as the last occurence of a wildfire at a particular location.
 
Finally, historic climate conditions may not be accurate given climate change and changing weather conditions, as alluded to in our introduction. Thus, we may look into extrapolating current climate change patterns to more accurately supplement our inputs.
 
The results from this project can be used to assist the EPA with forecasting the probability of wildfires in particular locations to take proactive measures to stop or mitigate the spread of the fires. In the case that a fire occurs, using the results from the intensity model, environmental organizations and firefighters will be able to gather appropriate resources to stop the spread further.
