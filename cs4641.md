Hello! 

### Problem Definition 

We are creating a model to predict the damage a wildfire can cause in a particular area on a specific day of the year. To create this model, we will combine datasets that contain information on previous fires, how long it took to contain those fires and the area of land damaged by those fires.

### Methods

To predict whether or not there will be a wildfire, given a time and location, we’ll use a wildfire prediction dataset to create a model using supervised learning to classify the given inputs as “fire” or “no_fire” (binary classification). The wildfire prediction dataset provides us with a list of certain indexes, NVDI and LST, which can be determined using the time and location parameters, as well as whether or not there was a wildfire or not. Therefore, we can extract the relationship between these factors and the occurrence of a wildfire.
If our first model has predicted that it is likely for there to be a fire, we’ll train a second model using supervised learning to estimate the overall damage of the fire (logistic regression?). The dataset contains a list of wildfires, with each having a location, time, rain, temperature, and other indexes, along with the area of burned land. Using this dataset, we’ll be able to train a model to take an input of these features, and output the area of burned land.

### Potential Results

For the binary classification problem, we expect to obtain a high degree of accuracy, taking cue from the results obtained by Sayad et al [cited below] on predictive modelling of wildfires using the same dataset. For the subsequent risk assessment problem, we expect the following features to emerge as strongly related to damage assessment:  relative humidity, wind speed, temperature, and rain. However, our accuracy of burned land area may not be as high due to a few reasons. Our model may or may not be able to model the years of time gap between two forest fires in the same region accounting for the natural phenomenon of forest regrowth, differing amounts of forest cover, inaccurate local temperatures due to climate change, etc. We may be able to improve this by supplementing our training dataset with more data, and web scraping to find these features for our input vectors.
If the model is robust, we hope to be able to generalize these results for locations outside the United States.
